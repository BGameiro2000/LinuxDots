# BGameiro's Package Recommendation

This file has my recommendations on what packages to use.

This was one of the most difficult issues to overcome when I changed for Linux because there are **so many options**, unfortunately not all good, so I decided to list what packages I use or have used.

This includes all software from free and open source to commercial, from simple scripts to complex applications, from web apps to selfhosted services.
