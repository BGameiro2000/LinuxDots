# BGameiro's Package Recommendation

This file has my recommendations on what packages to use.

This was one of the most difficult issues to overcome when I changed for Linux because there are **so many options**, unfortunately not all good, so I decided to list what packages I use or have used.

This includes all software from free and open source to commercial, from simple scripts to complex applications, from web apps to selfhosted services.

##      Basic system utilities

###     Bootloader

I prefer [Systmd-boot](). It supports multiple OS, is fast and is already installed.

###     Display server

You have 2 main choices: [Xorg]() and [Wayland](). 

Xorg is the old standard and many applications and WM/DE need it. Wayland is the new alternative with more functionalities but isn't as mature. I use Xorg for now.
