## How is this repo organized?

There are 4 directories in this repo:
*   ArchCustom
     *   Includes my custom pacman repository, the AUR packages that I use, an example of a PKGBUILD, my pacman.conf and a live system configured as mine.
*   Configs
     *   Includes all the configurations for boot loaders, display servers, display managers, window managers and other applications.
*   Media
     *   Includes my wallpapers and other media, media related to this repo and previews of my system.
*   Scripts
     *   Includes the scripts that I use.

Each directory may have its own README file.

This repo includes an [installation and configuration guide](Installation.md) based on Arch Wiki and my installation scripts at the end. It also has a [recommended application list](Applications.md) with the apps that better fit my transition from Windows to inux as well as my workflow.

## Licenses and credit

My configurations and scripts are under the GPLv3 license but the packages that I use and have listed in my repository aren't mine, have their own licenses and are owned by their respective owners. Note that my wallpapers come from wallpaperup and thus are not mine.

Also my configurations are based on my own ideas and my workflow as well as the following r/unixporn and r/FirefoxCSS posts:
